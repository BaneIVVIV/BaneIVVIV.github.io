			How to nerf the F2, A more balanced character

		  <strong>Warning!</strong> I am a toxic player

		  <div class="col-sm-4">
		  	<h2>First step</h2>
		  	<p>One of the strongest things that lead to the power of the F2 is a sight that far outweighs the other counterparts.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-sm-8">
		  	<h2>Acog Removal</h2>
		  	<p>One of the most terrifying things about the F2 is it's ability to hit people from half the map away. This is due to the acog which has the highest base zoom on an assault rifle it makes it a monster.</p>
		  	<p>It's removal would cause a lot of joy from the majority of the community as well because of the menace Twitch has been on the community inspiring working alone in this team based game.</p>
		  </div>

		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-sm-4">
		  	<h2>Second Step</h2>
		  	<p>Another issue with the F2 is the insane recoil control that is possible with the gun</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-sm-8">
		  	<h2>Recoil Pattern</h2>
		  	<p>The recoil pattern for the F2 is a direct up and very minimal, which for an insane fire rate weapon is extremely unreasonable</p>
		  	<p>As it is unrealistic to the real F2 it should be more in line with it's Famas counterpart in real life with a more uncontrollable recoil pattern to the left generally.
		  	</p>
		  </div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
		  <div class="col-sm-4">
		  	<h2>Final Step</h2>
		  	<p>One final thing to bring the F2 into line would to either lower the ADS time or to decrease movement speed</p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="col-sm-8">
		  	<h2>ADS/Movement</h2>
		  	<p>Lastly as the character as a 2 speed operator has some of the fastest movement in class while using the F2, so either nerfing the mobility itself or the time to the ADS time as the hipfire accuracy is one of the only balanced things with this gun.</p>
